# Objective
To assess the long-term validity of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) in the GBP/CAD exchange rate and to develop a statistical model suitable for short-term exchange rate forecasting, providing empirical support for exchange rate risk management and policy analysis.

# Methodology
Based on monthly data from the UK and Canada (2015–2025), including nominal exchange rates, real exchange rates, and CPIs for both countries, we applied ADF tests to examine stationarity, OLS regression to test relative PPP, and the Box-Jenkins methodology to construct multiple ARIMA models. Model selection was conducted using AIC/BIC criteria and residual diagnostics.

# Results
Empirical findings indicate that neither absolute nor relative PPP holds, with exchange rate deviations showing persistence. The ARIMA(0,1,1) model was identified as optimal, with residuals consistent with white noise assumptions, demonstrating stable predictive performance over the short term (1–3 months). This offers actionable quantitative insights for financial institutions in exchange rate hedging and decision-making.
